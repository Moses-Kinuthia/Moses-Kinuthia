# 🛡️ Moses's Security Operations Center

### 👨‍💻 Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Teamer | Threat Hunter

Welcome to my digital workshop. I focus on **defensive security**, monitoring network telemetry, and building resilient environments. I believe that security is not a product, but a continuous process of detection and response.
